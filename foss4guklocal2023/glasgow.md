11:15 - 11:45|<details closed><summary>Mike Spencer [Smart Data Foundry]</summary>Mike leads the research data science team at Smart Data Foundry and has a background in climate and the environment, economics and social science. His previous work has included agriculture, supply chains, rural economy, hydrology, digital skills and social services. He has a PhD from the University of Edinburgh in snow hydrology and a BSc in Environmental Science from Lancaster University. Mike is a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, a member of the Society of Research Software Engineers and a convener of the EdinbR R user group.</details>|<details closed><summary>Beyond the *IMD - filling the gap</summary>The Index of Multiple Deprivation is an essential tool for policy making and service delivery. It's a critical benchmark that brings together disparate data sources including crime statistics, service access, health and financial data. However, the last time the SIMD (Scotland's IMD) was updated was in 2020. Since then we've had Brexit, COVID and Russia's invasion of Ukraine leading to a cost of living crisis. At Smart Data Foundry, we are working with NatWest Group data to develop a financial wellbeing index at a weekly timestep to provide up-to-date information to decision-makers and bridge the gap between *IMD updates. Come to this talk to hear about the privacy-preserving FOSS tools we're using to develop this new financial wellbeing index.</details>
11:45 - 12:15|<details closed><summary>Junaid Abdul Jabbar [University of Cambridge]</summary>Junaid is a Geoinformatics Engineer with a Bachelor’s degree (2015) from National University of Sciences & Technology, Pakistan and Master’s degree (2019) from Institute of Space Technology, Pakistan.</details>|<details closed><summary>Mapping Archaeological Heritage in South Asia: open-source technologies and sustainability</summary>Mapping Archaeological Heritage in South Asia (MAHSA) project aims at documenting the endangered archaeology and cultural heritage of the Indus River Basin. MAHSA project focuses on the use of open-source technologies such as QGIS, PostgreSQL, Open Data Kit, and Arches database platform for digitizing and recording data from various sources including legacy data, historic maps, remote sensing, and automated site detection methods. The use of low-cost open-source technologies accompanied with a series of training sessions for local stakeholders addresses the project’s goal of long-term sustainability of the data recording mechanism and the Arches database, which aspires to serve as the primary mapping resource and research repository for the archaeological and endangered cultural heritage of the region.</details>

You can see Steven's work on twitter and mastodon under @stevefaeembra</details>|<details closed><summary>Introduction to using Blender for 3d cartography (Workshop)</summary>A hands-on walkthrough of how to use Blender to create a 3d map.</details>

If you would like to participate in Steven's workshop, please bring your own device and install Blender 3.5+ beforehand - although no prior knowledge of Blender is required. You can bring your own geoTIFF if desired, but some ready-made DEMs and textures will also be made available. A GPU is not required, **but a mouse is strongly recommended**.

MapServer plays a crucial part in one of our longest running projects, The Pavement Management System (PMS). This is a web-based mapping application designed for the management of roadway and active travel infrastructure maintenance in Ireland. It is developed for the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and utilised by all 31 Local Authorities in Ireland. This presentation will centre around how our WMS, WFS and OCI API endpoints are designed and built in backend (using libraries like mappyfile), as well as the myriad of ways in which these services are consumed by our end users.</details>|
