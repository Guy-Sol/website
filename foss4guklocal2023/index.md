## FOSS4G:UK Local 
## Thurs 7<sup>th</sup> Sept 2023

**Call for Talks is now Closed**


[OSGeo:UK](https://uk.osgeo.org/) will be bringing together all those interested in free and open source software for geospatial (FOSS4G) for this fantastic event. If you use, promote, develop or want to learn about open source tools and open data for geospatial, then this conference is for you! A whole day of talks, workshops and networking across the UK and Ireland. Take a look at our previous programmes for [FOSS4G:UK Local 2022](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ChtOtqO0PfZ2ckiZqqJxyV3VhP3Xm-WnkJ6NwZ2UVTM/edit#gid=1605024148),  [FOSS4GUK Online 2020](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4gukonline2020/programme.html) and [FOSS4GUK 2019 in Edinburgh](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2019/FOSS4GUK_2019_Programme.pdf) to get a flavour of things to come!

This will be a hybrid conference, but with a twist: there will be no central physical location. We have eight venues geographically dispersed across the UK and Ireland, where you can physically meet up to attend the conference. The two keynote presentations and panel session will be streamed to all venues. Additional sessions will be run at each local venue.

If there is no physical location near you, you can join remotely and view the streamed sessions from wherever you are. We will also have the [OSGeo:UK Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#OSGeoUK:matrix.org) to allow people to chat to each other before, during and after the event.

If you are interested in volunteering at one of the venues below, please get in touch via [our mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk){:target="_newpage"}, [our Matrix Chat Room](https://matrix.to/#/%23OSGeoUK:matrix.org){:target="_newpage"} or <span class="osgeoemail"></span>.

We are adopting a similar structure to last year, with the keynotes and panel discussion streamed to all venues and to YouTube.

## Call for Talks

The call for talks has now closed, as of Monday 7th August. Thank you to everyone that submitted.

Local event schedules are being finalised and will be released on the local event pages by Monday 14th August. Anyone that submitted will be contacted regarding acceptance before Monday 14th August 2023.

The programme will feature talks, presentations, workshops, and show & tell sessions, covering:
- New/updated FOSS4G software
- Interesting applications of FOSS4G across industry, commercial, public sector or third sector
- How to use FOSS4G and related software at a range of levels

## Registration

[Registration](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/foss4g-uk-local-2023-tickets-663598610307){:target="_newpage"} is now open! Book early to bag your place - last year almost all venues sold out. Additionally, refunds are available from Eventbrite (less a service fee) up to seven days before the event.

After much discussion, we have decided to charge a nominal fee of £20 for a ticket to attend. This is not a decision we have taken lightly, and is primarily due to a high rate of no-shows at some venues last year (up to 40%, see [lessons learned from 2022 for more details](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2022local/lessons-learned.html)). No-shows prevent others who would like to attend from attending and we end up over ordering on catering and wasting food. 

We want FOSS4G:UK Local 2023 to be as accessible as possible, so we have a number of codes available for free tickets. These are available for students, under represented groups, those on a low income, those in precarious employment, those who would like to volunteer and anyone else for whom a £20 ticket would be a barrier (financial or administrative). All of these criteria are self-defined. We very much encourage you to reach out to <span class="osgeoemail"></span> to ask for a code, stating which group you belong to (no further justification is needed). 

Any surplus made from the tickets will join any surplus from the sponsorship and conference as a whole, and be used to allow OSGeo:UK to provide financial support to open source geospatial projects (for example see [Past Donations](https://uk.osgeo.org/pastdonations.html) to see how we have supported open source geospatial project previously). 

Join our [our mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk){:target="_newpage"} to keep up to date with news. 

## Code of Conduct

Participants at FOSS4G:UK Local 2023 are expected to act respectfully toward others in accordance with the [FOSS4G:UK Online Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct). *Short version: everyone is welcome, make everyone welcome, be nice.*
