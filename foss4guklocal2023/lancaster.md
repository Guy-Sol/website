## Staying On

Fraser House is very close to The White Cross pub, which also does food, and if anyone is staying around after
the close of the conference then this will probably be our first call.

Also happening on the day of the conference
is the [Lancaster Jazz Festival](https://www.lancasterjazz.com/2023-festival/) 
(6th to the 10th of September). If you are in Lancaster for the evening then check
out the gig listing on the web site. Grrreat.

Lancaster also has plenty of other restaurants and pubs - ask Barry or any other local
attendees for information.
