### Venue Accessibility

The building is situated with very generous public space created outside the main entrance. All spaces in the four storey block are accessible to wheelchair users as are all ground floor entrances. Accessible WC facilities are available at entry level and all other levels. 

We encourage everyone to travel by public transport/car share/under their own steam if possible.
