### Venue Accessibility
The Eolas Building is situated in the very heart of the University's North Campus among several of the other science buildings. Outside of the Eolas building is a very generous public space and entrance area. All spaces in the building are accessible to wheelchair users as are all ground floor entrances. Accessible WC facilities are available at entry level and all other levels. 

The Lab 019 is the venue room. This room is a state-of-the-art Computing teaching lab space usually used for Postgraduate teaching and small groups. There are over 30 individual seats in the room set out with generous workspace between each seat station. All of the seat stations are equipped with ergonomic chairs with individual plug sockets and USB outlets. [Eduroam](https://www.eduroam.ie/) WiFi is available in the room for those who have access this network. The public [MU-Guest WiFi network](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/it-services/wi-fi) is available to guests who do not have Eduroam access.    

We encourage everyone to travel by public transport/car share/under their own steam if possible. Information on public transportation options you can use to reach Maynooth University are available on the University webpage [Getting to Maynooth using Public Transport](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/location/commuting)

### Car Parking
Some delegates will use their cars to reach Maynooth. We are fortunate that September 7th is still considered outside term time - therefore there should be ample parking available throughout the North Campus of the University. This means that you can park in **any properly designated parking space** within the car parks available. Car park 4 and Car park 5A are the closest car parks to the Eolas Building. You will see signs regarding parking permits for these car parks but, happily, permit-based parking will not be enforced until the end of September. This being said, please ensure that you park in a designated space.
